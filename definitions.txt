Wireless access point which allows a device to access a LAN without a wired connection
A relational database table structure that has no repeating fields or groups of fields
IP address format which uses 32 bits, such as 200.21.100.6

All non-key columns must depend on the entire primary key
The third step in normalizing a database and it builds on the first and second normal forms, 1NF and 2NF
An algorithm that finds the shortest route between nodes or vertices but uses an additional heuristic approach to achieve better performance than Dijkstra's algorithm
Type of test data that should be rejected by a program
Mode of addressing in which the contents of the memory location in the operand are used
A data type that is a collection of data and a set of operations on that data
The process of extracting information that is essential, while ignoring what is not relevant, for the provision of a solution
The testing of a completed program to prove to the customer that it works as required
A state the system reaches when the input string is valid
Use of access levels to ensure only authorised users can gain access to certain data
The permissions given to database users to access, modify or delete data
Temporary general purpose register which stores numerical values at any part of a given operation
Message sent to a receiver to indicate that data has been received without error
Association for Computing Machinery
The alteration of a program to perform new tasks
Carries the addresses throughout the computer system
Different methods of using the operand part of a machine code instruction as a memory address
Wireless connectivity that uses radio waves & microwaves
An ordered set of steps to be followed in the completion of a task
The testing of a completed or nearly completed program in-house by the development team
Needed to convert analogue data (read from sensors, for example) into a form understood by a computer
Part of the program development lifecycle; a process of investigation, leading to the specification of what a program is required to do
Software that quarantines and deletes files or programs infected by a virus (or other malware); it can be run in the background or initiated by the user
File access mode in which data can be added to the end of a file
The value passed to a procedure or function
Logic unit (ALU)
The sign of the number is preserved
Advanced Research Projects Agency Network
A data structure containing several elements of the same data type
Machine or application which carries out a task that requires some degree of intelligence when carried out by a human counterpart
Networks of interconnected nodes based on the interconnections between neurons in the human brain; the system is able to think like a human using these neural networks, and its performance improves with more data
Coding system for all the characters on a keyboard and control codes
A computer program that translates programming code written in assembly language into machine code; assemblers can be one pass or two pass
A low level languge that is similar to machine code
Encryption that uses both public keys (known to everyone) and private keys (secret keys)
Serial refers to a single wire being used to transmit bits of data one after the other; asynchronous refers to a sender using its own clock/ timer device rather sharing the same clock/timer with the recipient device
Deterioration of signal
In database management systems, sometimes used as a synonym for field
A named piece of data stored within an object
Method used to reduce the size of a sound file using perceptual music shaping
A way of proving somebody or something is who or what they claim to be
A method of data verification. A sends information to B. A keeps copy of message and B sends the message back when it has received it. If A doesn't hear from B then A sends it again after a reasonable amount of time
Method used in artificial neural networks to calculate error gradients so that actual node/neuron weightings can be adjusted to improve the performance of the model
Software that makes copies of files on another portable storage device
A formal method of defining the grammatical rules of a programming language
A faulty sector on an HOD which can be soft or hard
